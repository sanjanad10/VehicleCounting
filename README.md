Traffic Management using vehicle counting using computer vision 
Traffic congestion is a pressing issue in urban areas, leading to delays, increased pollution, and road safety concerns. The proposed Traffic Management System (TMS) addresses these challenges by employing computer vision techniques for real-time traffic monitoring and control. The system is built on a layered architecture that ensures functionality, scalability, and reliability. Using the YOLOv8x object detection algorithm, the system identifies, tracks, and counts vehicles in video feeds transmitted by high-definition cameras. A region-based vehicle counting approach enhances accuracy, even in dense traffic and challenging conditions like poor lighting. The core of the system is the TMS logic, which adjusts traffic signals dynamically based on vehicle frequency thresholds. Parameters such as minimum and maximum green signal times and vehicle frequency are integrated into the decision-making process, ensuring balanced and adaptive traffic flow. A user interface developed with Streamlit provides real-time visualization of processed videos, including bounding boxes, vehicle counts, and dynamically updated traffic signals. This innovative system offers a scalable, efficient, and user-friendly solution to modern traffic challenges, reducing delays, improving road efficiency, and supporting sustainable urban development.
